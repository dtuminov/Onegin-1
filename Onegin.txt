Why scream when nobody hears
What are we talking about...
It seems to me that we have not been alive for a long time -
We lit up and we will burn out on the sly.
When there are many of us the fire starts
And cities are like a crematorium and a bazaar.
And everyone is used to noticing anything -
When they can't hear you, why shout?
We can be silent, we can sing
Stand or run, but still burn.
The huge blue whale cannot break the net.
Give up or not, but still burn!
